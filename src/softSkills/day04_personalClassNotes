                    done by devs. they know or "can see" what is inside the "box"
Black Box Testing - testing without technical knowledge of application or code structure. done by manual
                    testers, clients, and end users. Black box means they don't know or cannot "see" what's
                    inside the "box." Zero technical knowledge.
Gray Box Testing - testing with partial knowledge of internal code structure. you can "partially see" inside
                   the box. automation engineers, performance testers and security engineers. the minute you use
                   code and automate you do gray box testing. Alpha UAT testing if done by someone with knowledge
                   of the internal code structure, it is gray box testing

Unit Testing - Component testing, testing code, done by devs. level 1 testing

Integration Testing - level 2 testing.

System Testing - SDET/QA validates all functions. UI, API and DB.
            TWO PARTS - Functional and Non Functional

UAT Testing - Staging enviroment. A/B testing. Client verifies. last step before production
