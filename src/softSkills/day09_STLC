STLC - Software Testing Lifecycle

Step 1: Requirements Analysis
    Analyze and understand requirements on a high level.
    release plan meeting with PM - PM introduces release info, functions/requirments, testing strategy document

    each release is a certain number of sprints

    test strategy document is a word document outlining testing scope, strategy, testing tools, and other things
    testing environments
    risks and mitigation
    QAs study and learn what to work on

    testing scope: Testing strategy, types, and tools

    functionalities and due date will change a little, but most of it will remain the same
    you can always go and check this document

    Who are the testers?
    What is the schedule?

Step 2: Test Plan Creation

    Word Document
    SDETs get together and create it

    contains test strategy info, QA role and responsibility, and any software or hardware resources that I need

    Test plan doc is project level and carried by QA team - How to test and little details
    Test Strategy doc is organizational level and carried by PM - scope of test, risk and higher level objectives


Step 3: Test Case Creation
    Excel document
    creat test case for every single user story

    shows test data, expected result and other fields

    ID - unique number
    Description - short description of stuff
    Environment - Which environment are we using?
    Steps - small and detailed
    Test Data - Data we input into application to test it
    Expected result - What we want from the application

    Actual result
    we Pass/Fail it at the end
